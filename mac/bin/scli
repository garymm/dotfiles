# cp Library/LaunchAgents/dbus-session.plist $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/dbus-session.plist

# launchctl bootout gui/${loggedInUserID}/dbus-session
# launchctl bootstrap gui/${loggedInUserID} $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/dbus-session.plist
# launchctl kickstart -p gui/${loggedInUserID}/dbus-session
# launchctl print gui/${loggedInUserID}/dbus-session

# TODO: report a bug to homebrew about launchd.
# I was going to but my `brew doctor` had a bunch of warnings that
# I'm pretty sure were unrelated but I was too lazy to resolve.
